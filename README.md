# Database-project
A primary school database written using the c language

You can find the main program in the main.c file.

What this program does is that is accepts multiple subject grades from input along with a student's first and last name. A student average is then calculated and that information is written to a text file to serve as a database.

The program has 3 main funtions:

1) add a new record
2) genorate a report of all students
3) sort and display all students by average
4) terminate the program.
